figure9-27,Cobblestone (paving stone) degeneration. Areas of pigmentation are observed within the discrete areas of depigmentation.
figure9-28,"Grouped pigmentation. Small clumps of grouped pigmentation (""bear tracks""; inset) have little risk of malignant transformation."
figure9-29,Pigmented fundus lesions associated with Gardner's syndrome. Note the depigmented halo (arrowhead) and oblong shape of the lesion.
figure9-30A,"Peripheral retinoschisis. Note the smooth, dome-shaped elevation in the inferotemporal quadrant(arrows)."
figure9-30B,Degenerative retinoschisis Wide-angle photograph of inferotemporal retinoschisis(lower left). The external transillumination is noted (directly left).
figure9-31,"Degenerative retinoschisis, outer wall breaks. Outer wall holes associated with retinoschisis (inset) are required to cause a retinoschisis-associated retinal detachment. Note that the inner-layer retinal vessels course over the outer-layer retinal holes."
figure9-32,"Degenerative retinoschisis, outer wall breaks. Laser treatment (arrows) surrounding outerwall holes (asterisks) in retinoschisis."
figure9-33,Exudative RD associated with Coats' disease (arrow). Note the subretinal lipid precipitates where the exudative RD is shallower.
figure9-34,"Exudative RD overlying choroidal melanoma with retinal hemorrhages. This smooth, dome-shaped elevation extends beyond the choroidal melanoma."
figure9-35,Exudative RD. This detachment exhibited shifting subretinal fluid with change of position.
